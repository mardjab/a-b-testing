# A/B Testing with Cookie Cats

In Data Science, A/B testing is a basic randomized control experiment that compares two versions of a variable to find out which performs better in a controlled environment.

In this project, we'll use a dataset extracted from the mobile puzzle game Cookie Cats to analyze if different versions of gates that players encounter throughout the game impact player retention.
